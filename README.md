# ToughFlix Frontend

ToughFlix is a movie application that takes the stress of picking a movie out with another person and makes the choice a bit easier. This is done through connecting with a person and being able to reject or accept a movie from a list that is shared between the two.

The inspiration for this app was simple. In every relationship, whatever kind of relationship that is, being able to agree on something simple like picking a movie can be time consuming. ToughFlix takes that time and gives it back to you!
